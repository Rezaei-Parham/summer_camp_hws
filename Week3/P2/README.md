# Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named `GCN.ipynb` that demonstrates the implementation of a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) using PyTorch Geometric library. The notebook focuses on the node property prediction task using the `ogbn-products` dataset, which represents an Amazon product co-purchasing network.

## Dataset Description

The `ogbn-products` dataset is an undirected and unweighted graph that represents the co-purchasing relationships between products sold on Amazon. Each node in the graph represents a product, and the edges indicate that the products are purchased together. The node features are generated by extracting bag-of-words features from the product descriptions, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimension to 100. The task is to predict the category of a product in a multi-class classification setup, where the 47 top-level categories are used as target labels.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook successfully, please ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

- PyTorch (version >= 1.12.0)
- PyTorch Geometric
- ogb
- torch-scatter
- torch-sparse

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install torch
pip install torch-geometric
pip install ogb
pip install torch-scatter -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-{torch.__version__}.html
pip install torch-sparse -f https://pytorch-geometric.com/whl/torch-{torch.__version__}.html
```

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed as mentioned above.
2. Open the `GCN.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code step by step.
4. The notebook will download the `ogbn-products` dataset, preprocess it, and train a GCN model for the node property prediction task.
5. The training progress and evaluation results will be displayed for each epoch.
6. After training, the model's performance on the train, validation, and test sets will be shown.
7. Optionally, you can save the model predictions on the test set by setting `save_model_results` to `True` in the notebook.
