# LMH Summer Camp Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during the LMH Summer Camp. The projects are organized into separate directories for each week, ranging from Week 1 to Week 3. Each directory contains a different project showcasing various machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Week 1: Image Colorizer and Simpson Face Generator

The Week 1 directory contains two projects:

- **Image Colorizer**: The Image Colorizer project focuses on automatically adding color to grayscale images using deep learning techniques. The code provided demonstrates how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate colorized versions of grayscale images.

- **Simpson Face Generator**: The Simpson Face Generator project aims to generate new Simpson character faces using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The code showcases the implementation of a GAN architecture and provides instructions on how to train the model to generate realistic Simpson faces.

## Week 2: DQN for Frozen Lake Game

The Week 2 directory includes the following project:

- **DQN for Frozen Lake Game**: This project focuses on training an agent to navigate a frozen lake environment using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The code demonstrates how to implement the DQN algorithm and provides a step-by-step guide on training the agent.

## Week 3: DDPG, Actor-Critic, REINFORCE for Continuous Mountain Car, and GCN Graph

The Week 3 directory includes the following projects:

- **DDPG for Continuous Mountain Car**: In this project, the goal is to train an agent to solve the continuous mountain car problem using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The provided code explains the implementation of DDPG and provides instructions on training the agent to successfully reach the goal.

- **Actor-Critic for Continuous Mountain Car**: Similar to the previous project, this project utilizes the Actor-Critic algorithm to solve the continuous mountain car problem. The code showcases the implementation of the Actor-Critic algorithm and provides guidance on training the agent.

- **REINFORCE for Continuous Mountain Car**: This project focuses on training an agent to solve the continuous mountain car problem using the REINFORCE algorithm. The code demonstrates how to implement the REINFORCE algorithm and provides instructions on training the agent.

- **GCN Graph**: The GCN Graph project focuses on implementing a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) using the PyTorch Geometric library. The code demonstrates how to train a GCN model for the node property prediction task using the `ogbn-products` dataset.
